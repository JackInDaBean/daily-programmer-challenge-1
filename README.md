r/dailyprogrammer challenge #1

Create a program that will ask the users name, age, and reddit username. have it tell them the information back, in the format:
"your name is (blank), you are (blank) years old, and your username is (blank)"
for extra credit, have the program log this information in a file to be accessed later.

Program will read in the entries and then log them into a txt file.

Any comments or critiques would be appreciated!
